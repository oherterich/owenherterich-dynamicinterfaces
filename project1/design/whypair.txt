**We've got love down to a science.**

Unlike other dating sites, Pair doesn't mess around with self-assessments. Our patented process takes the uncertainty out of online dating and brings some simple biology into the picture. Forget about those uncomfortable first moments: you're guaranteed to feel on your way to a brighter, better future.

Enough from us. Let some of our early adopters tell you why Pair is right for you.

"After countless first dates, I felt like I had hit a dead end. I decided to give Pair a chance. Even after just one dinner, I knew that I had found someone that I could really care about. Pair is amazing!"

"I'm a busy guy. Scouring dozens of pages for someone I might get along with gets tiresome. Luckily, Pair found someone for me only weeks after I sent in my kit. I can't believe how easy it was to find the right one for me!"
