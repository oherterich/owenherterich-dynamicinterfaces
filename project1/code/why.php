						<h2>We've got love down to a science.</h2>
						<p>Unlike other dating sites, Pair doesn't mess around with self-assessments. Our patented process takes the uncertainty out of online dating and brings some simple biology into the picture. Forget about those uncomfortable first moments: you're guaranteed to feel on your way to a brighter, better future.</p>
						<p>Enough from us. Let some of our early adopters tell you why Pair is right for you.</p>

							<p>I'm a busy guy. Scouring dozens of pages for someone I might get along with gets tiresome. Luckily, Pair found someone for me only weeks after I sent in my kit. I can't believe how easy it was to find the right one for me!</p>

							<p>After countless first dates, I felt like I had hit a dead end. I decided to give Pair a chance. Even after just one dinner, I knew that I had found someone that I could really care about. Pair is amazing!</p>

							<p>I have a career that keeps me very busy, so it was hard for me to keep up with online dating. So, I gave Pair a try. It did the rest for me. It might sound crazy, but Peter and I had an instant connection. I don't exactly know how it works, but it made me happy, so I don't care!</p>
